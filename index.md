## Research directions

Most but not all of our work is in theoretical high energy nuclear physics. 

Our primary research interests irevolve around two main subject:  

{: .important-title }
> Hadrons at high energy 
>
> Nuclear structure and nuclear wave functions at high energies. Recent experiment and advances in theory suggest that, at high energies, every hadron, including proton, neutron and nucleus appear as dense “walls” of gluons, creating what might be among the strongest (chromo)electric and magnetic fields in nature. Studying this novel form of matter, the so-called color glass condensate, will help better understand non-linear dynamics of quantum-chromodynamics.


{: .important-title }
> QCD phase diagram 
> 
> Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in extreme conditions, including hight temperature, density or/and magnetic field. Phase diagram of QCD is the only one of Standard model of elementary particles that can be probed experimentaly. Out goal is to provide theoretical support to experemental colleagues to map out QCD phase diagram.
